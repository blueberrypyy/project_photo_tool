<h2>Exif Photo Tool</h2>

<p>Exif Photo Tool is a client-side tool that can output the exif data of any photo you upload. To get the exif data, just drag your photo or click in the box that says "Drop your files here". Currently the app will only allow you to view the exif data. In the future, I will make updates to expand functionality including the option to save the data to a .txt file and also include the option to remove the exif data of the photo.</p>

<h2>Dot Method Generator</h2>

<p>The Dot Method Generator is another JavaScript-based tool that will take your email and generate all possible iterations of your email while utilizing Google's dot method trick. You also have the option to save the output as a .txt file for your own scripts. If you don't know what the dot method is, please read on. If you own a Gmail account, you can put a period in between any character in the email username which will result in a new email that routs to your original email. This can be helpful if you want to create a catchall that routs to your main Gmail.</p>
